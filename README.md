# Factor-Analysis
**Factor analysis is a statistical techniques to study the inter-relationships among the variables in an effort to find a new set of factors, fever in number than the original variables so that the factors are common among the original variables.
There is difference between factor analysis and principal component analysis.
In principal component analysis the components are so selected that they can explain maximum variation in the original data set.
In factor analysis a small number of common factors are extracted so that these common factors are sufficient to study the relationships of original variables.
**
Factor analysis  helps the researcher to reduce the number of variables to be analyzed, thereby making the analysis easier.
For example, Consider a market researcher at a credit card company who wants to evaluate the credit card usage and behaviour of customers, using various variables. The variables include age, gender, marital status, income level, education, employment status, credit history and family background.
Analysis based on a wide range of variables can be tedious and time consuming.
Using Factor Analysis, the researcher can reduce the large number of variables into a few dimensions called factors that summarize the available data.
Its aims at grouping the original input variables into factors which underlying the input variables.
For example, age, gender, marital status can be combined under a factor called demographic characteristics. The income level, education, employment status can be combined under a factor called socio-economic status. The credit card and family background can be combined under factor called background status.

To identify the hidden dimensions or construct which may not be apparent from direct analysis

To identify relationships between variables

It helps in data reduction

It helps the researcher to cluster the product and population being analyzed.

****Factor: A factor is an underlying construct or dimension that represent a set of observed variables. In the credit card company example, the demographic characteristics, socio economic status and background status represent a set of variables.
Factor Loadings: Factor loading help in interpreting and labeling the factors. It measure how closely the variables in the factor are associated. It is also called factor-variable correlation. Factor loadings are correlation coefficients between the variables and the factors.
Eigen Values: Eigen values measure the variance in all the variables corresponding to the factor. Eigen values are calculated by adding the squares of factor loading of all the variables in the factor. It aid in explaining the importance of the factor with respect to variables.Generally factors with eigen values more than 1.0 are considered stable. The factors that have low eigen values (<1.0) may not explain the variance in the variables related to that factor.

Communalities: Communalities, denoted by h2, measure the percentage of variance in each variable explained by the factors extracted. It ranges from 0 to 1. A high communality value indicates that the maximum amount of the variance in the variable is explained by the factors extracted from the factor analysis.
Total Variance explained: The total variance explained is the percentage of total variance of the variables explained. This is calculating by adding all the communality values of each variable and dividing it by the number of variables.
Factor Variance explained: The factor variance explained is the percentage of total variance of the variables explained by the factors. This is calculating by adding the squared factor loadings of all the  variables and dividing it by the number of variables.

Varimax:  Minimize the complexity of the components by making the large loadings larger and the small loadings smaller within each component.

**Quartimax: Makes large loadings larger and small loadings smaller within each variable.

Equamax: A compromize between these two.
